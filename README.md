# 1- Protein Generator

Protein Generator is an algorithm in Python that creates arbitrary protein, outputting two matrices, representing the intervalar distance between any two atoms. It can be useful to small tests for the Distance Geometry Problem or the Molecular Geometry, mainly because the real instances are too big to validate any algorithm.
The algorithm uses the Python libraries math, numpy and random.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip install math
```
```bash
pip install numpy
```
```bash
pip install random
```

# 2- Extract Data NMR

This algorithm reads the input data originated from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and extracts only the important data, cleaning up to be easy to read the data. As all procedures were made by hand, this algorithm comes to help researches in the field of Molecular Geometry, making easy to extract the data.
The algorithm is done in python and does not use any specific library

# Usage

One just have to run the python files with the income data (for the extract algorithm) in the same folder. The outcomes will be automatically created.
